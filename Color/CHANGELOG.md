## 0.3.1

* Remove `RealFloat` constraint from `ColorSpace` for `Y'`

## 0.3.0

* Rename `Y` color model into `X` to avoid the annoying name conflict.
* Add `ColorSpace` instance for `Y'` and enrich it with base space info
* Rename `YCbCr` -> `Y'CbCr` and remove explicit linearity from its base space
* Fix BT470 transfer function. `ecctf` and `dcctf` were mixed up.
* Move `transfer` and `itransfer` functions into the `RedGreenBlue` class
* Move out `ecctf` and `dcctf` functions outside of `RedGreenBlue` class
* Remove all customized functions from RGB modules in favor of their respective class
  implementations:

  * `primaries` (standalone) -> `gamut` (in class)
  * `transfer` (standalone) -> `transfer` (in class)
  * `itransfer` (standalone) -> `itransfer` (in class)
  * `npmStandard` (standalone) -> `npm` (in class)
  * `inpmStandard` (standalone) -> `inpm` (in class)

* Addition of `coerceGamut`
* Fix re-export of vector's `MVector`, `Vector` type families.
* Re-arrange how modules are exported a little bit.

## 0.2.0

* Addition of `CIE1931 RGB` color space
* Add `Linearity` kind to `RedGreenBlue` color spaces.
* Add `Default` instance for `Pixel`
* Addition of universal division `(//)` to `Elevator`

* Fix show instance for floating point colors: adjust formatting in Elevator for `Float` and `Double`
* Add record accessor functions: `chromaticityCIExyY`, `whitePointChromaticity`
* Fix show instance for `Gamut`
* Remove deprecated: `CIECAM02` and `ciecam02Adaptation`

## 0.1.4

* Export `pixelColor`
* Add luma related patterns: `PixelY'`, `PixelY'A`, `Y'` and `Y'A`. Also `rgbPixelLuma`

## 0.1.3.1

  `BT709`, `BT601_525` and `BT601_625`

## 0.1.2

* Fix `YCbCr` conversion to derived RGB color spaces
* Fix conversion of `toWord64 (1 :: Double)` and `toWord632 (1 :: Float)`.
* Addition of `xyzColorMatchingFunctions` and `spectralPowerDistributions`

## 0.1.1

* Addition of `Graphics.Color.Illuminant.Wikipedia` module
* Addition of `convertColor` and `convertColorFloat` functions
